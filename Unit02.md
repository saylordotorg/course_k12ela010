**Unit 2: Short Stories** <span id="2"></span> 
*Before delving into longer, more rigorous texts, it wil be helpful for
you to digest a series of shorter stories. This will allow you to
practice reading skills, literary analysis, and response writing on a
variety of texts with different themes, styles, and techniques.  
    
 For each story, you will learn the literary devices used therein. You
will assess the author’s tone, style, theme(s), and message. The stories
will be used to practice close reading practices, such as annotating,
questioning, and drawing inferences. Additionally, you will be exposed
to a range of influential writers, genres, and time periods. Overall,
the stories will serve as an introduction to literary traditions as well
as a vehicle for textual interpretation and response.  
    
 Although these stories can stand on their own (thus serving as the
subunit titles), you will be expected to compare and contrast their
content and style. You will draw thematic connections across the
literature and use these connections to ultimately write a formal
literary response paper. At the end of this unit, you will have the
terminology, reading practices, and critical eye needed for a close,
meaningful examination of texts/literature.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 56 hours:  
    
 ☐    Subunit 2.1: 10 hours  
    
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 6 hours  
    
 ☐    Subunit 2.3: 6 hours  
    
 ☐    Subunit 2.4: 11 hours  
    
 ☐    Subunit 2.5: 4 hours  
    
 ☐    Subunit 2.6: 3 hours  
    
 ☐    Subunit 2.7: 16 hours

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   identify and evaluate the key elements, terminology, and traditions
    of literature;
-   analyze an author’s message, intent, and writing style, and respond
    critically to it using textual support; and
-   compare and contrast the views and methodology of two
    writers/speakers, analyzing how these similarities and differences
    affect the message.

**2.1 “2BR02B” by Kurt Vonnegut** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*“2BR02B,” pronounced “To Be or Naught to Be,” with naught being another
name for the number zero, is a science fiction short story by Kurt
Vonnegut, Jr. The story takes place in the future in a society where
population control is not a problem. I won’t ruin the story for you by
giving away the plot, but pay special attention to exactly what must
happen for this ideal population control to take place. Think about the
theme of utopia (a perfect world) and the dystopia (chaos) that often
occurs. How closely related are utopia and dystopia? Are they worlds
apart, or is there only a fine line separating the two? Enjoy the
story!*

**2.2 “The Country of the Blind” by H. G. Wells** <span
id="2.2"></span> 
*This short story is a real eye-opener (ha, ha, ha—I crack myself up)!
Really though, this guy finds himself in an isolated area where being
blind has become “normal.” At first, he thinks, “Oh yeah, I’m the man in
this land! I can see everything, and they can see nothing!” But shortly,
he finds that that is not the case at all. His sight becomes a
disability for him, and ultimately he must choose whether his sight or
his love for a blind woman is most important. This story will really
make you think about what it means to be an alien in another country,
uncertain of the customs and traditions that you may believe to be
“normal.” It also brings thoughts of what a disability really is and how
that disability may be defined by circumstances surrounding it.*

**2.3 “An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge” by Ambrose Bierce** <span
id="2.3"></span> 
*If you thought “The Country of the Blind” was an eye-opener, then “An
Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge” will really keep you hanging! Oh my! You
will have to read the story to understand what I mean by “hanging”!
Basically, this short story is about a man’s last thoughts before dying.
There are many hints about what is actually going on—foreshadowing, if
you will, and then a surprise ending that I will not ruin for you. Rest
assured, the imagery and foreshadowing alone will keep you engaged in
this one.*

**2.3.3 Annotating** <span id="2.3.3"></span> 
*What in the world is annotating? It’s really just a fancy name for
taking notes as you read. That may mean highlighting things you want to
remember or making notes to yourself about a certain passage that you
may want to come back to. Annotation is a really handy thing to know how
to do, especially if you are going to write a literary analysis.*

**2.4 “The Pit and the Pendulum” by Edgar Allan Poe** <span
id="2.4"></span> 
*Moving along in our short story unit, this tale takes another look at
impending doom. Unlike the main character in “An Occurrence at Owl Creek
Bridge,” the main character in “The Pit and the Pendulum” is not only
facing death, but a torturous one. This story examines the horror and
fear brought on by various tortures of the Spanish Inquisition. Turn
down the lights, make some popcorn, and enjoy this creepy story.*

     Instructions: Read this handout about author’s voice and point of
    view. As you read, be sure to pay attention to the information about
    the author’s voice and the narrator’s point of view not always being
    the same. Do you think the narrator in “The Pit and the Pendulum”is
    speaking with Poe’s voice or in a different point of view? What
    makes you think this? Find some examples to prove it!  
        
     Reading this handout and answering the questions above should take

    Characterization”](http://www.sophia.org/analyzing-characterization/analyzing-characterization-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Now, get ready to have some fun! This little
    informative sheet is going to guide you through an analysis of a
    character. It asks you to choose a character from the story, and
    well, you don’t really have a huge choice—it’s going to need to be
    the narrator. But that means the first step is already done for you!
    So, with the narrator of “The Pit and the Pendulum” as your subject,
    proceed question by question through this exercise. Work your way
    through the questions in Step 2 and Step 3. If you would like to
    look at the example first, it may help you in “stalking” your
    character. And they couldn’t have chosen a better example for
    you—another Poe story! Also, if you have been annotating as you
    read, a lot of the answers to the questions will be obvious.

**2.5 Dracula’s Guest by Bram Stoker** <span id="2.5"></span> 
*Just when you thought it was over…another short story from the Dark
Romantic genre. This short story was published after Stoker’s death.
Some say it is from the original manuscript of* Dracula*. Regardless of
its origin, it is a story worth reading and studying. Be sure to make
annotations as you read the story, highlighting examples that help you
to understand why the author wrote the story (theme) and how his
characters’ actions and words carry out the theme. Enjoy the story!*

     Instructions: Read this great presentation about Dark
    Romanticism/Gothic elements in Poe’s work. After reading through the
    slides, see if you can identify any of these elements in Stoker’s
    “Dracula’s Guest.” Be sure to cite specific examples of these
    elements as you find them. Then, I bet you can guess what is
    next…you get to compare and contrast “The Pit and the Pendulum” and
    “Dracula’s Guest.”  
        
     Think about both stories in a dark romantic way, then choose
    certain elements to compare and contrast. For example, you may
    choose to compare and contrast the settings, imagery, tones,
    symbolism, and so forth. Be sure to show specific examples to prove
    the things you are saying.

**2.6 Comparing Literary Traditions** <span id="2.6"></span> 
*Okay, so we know what comparing is, but what is a literary tradition? A
literary tradition is simply a group or collection of literature that,
for a long, long time, has included the same themes or ideas or styles
of writing. So, for example, the first two short stories we read,
“2BR02B” and “The Country of the Blind,” both had settings that were
utopian in different ways. In that way, those stories are from the same
literary tradition. So, think about the other stories you have read in
this unit, decide what themes they have that are similar, and then you
will get to compare the different literary traditions.*

     Instructions: Watch this video about identifying theme. When you
    are finished, watch it one more time, this time thinking about the
    information in light of “Dracula’s Guest.” Then, write down what you
    think the theme is in “Dracula’s Guest.” Is there more than one? Can
    you show examples from the story that prove what you think the theme

**2.7 In-Depth Literary Response** <span id="2.7"></span> 
*Now it’s time to put all of the skills you have acquired into action!
You get to choose two of the short stories we have read and compare and
contrast them. In this writing, you will look at the literary elements
used in each story and decide which ones are similar and which ones are
not similar. To prove this in your writing, you are going to have to
show, or cite, specific examples. Then you will explain how these
specific examples show the literary devices that are similar and not
similar. It sounds like a lot, but really it’s just like eating an
elephant! And the only way to eat an elephant is one…bite…at…a…time.
Let’s get started!*

    on this one. These slides will guide you through a comparison and
    contrast of two fairy tales. This activity begins on slide 5 and
    will be great practice, so please read the fairy tales and follow
    through with the assignment on the remaining slides. Take notes,
    take notes, take notes!

    and why we use it. It also explains two or three different formats
    for using citation. Look this over, know it exists, and remember
    that someday you will need to use it. Fortunately, that day is not
    today! In your literary analysis, you will only need to cite those
    examples that you take from the story. Since you will not be using
    outside sources, you can simply follow the examples from the
    wonderful information given below in subunit 2.7.2.

     Instructions: Click on the link and explore. There is SO much
    useful information here, and I want you to savor every morsel!  
        
     To begin, watch the video. Now, get some paper and a pen and write
    your own “literary analysis claim,” A.K.A., thesis statement, about
    one of the short stories you have read in this unit. Okay, now write
    another statement for another one of the stories we have read. Set
    these aside, but keep them close.  
        
     Now on to the slides. Read through them, thinking about the two
    short stories you have chosen from this unit. When you get to Slide
    6, pick one of these two stories and answer the questions about it.
    Then, answer those same questions about the other story you chose.
    Again, set these aside, but keep them handy.  
        
     The next set of slides contains step-by-step instructions to write
    a literary analysis. This material takes the information from the
    guide in Subunit 2.7.1 and adds a lot more detail about what to
    include in your introduction, body, and conclusion. It even talks
    about how to title your paper! This is some good stuff that you will
    probably come back to time and time again.  
        
     Finally, there are some excellent links that will provide you with
    more helpful hints for writing literary analyses. These are all
    great tips and you should read over them too.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 3 hours.

     Instructions: First, draw a Venn diagram to brainstorm the elements
    you listed about each of the short stories you chose. Hopefully, you
    chose two stories that have some common elements, and you will see
    those in the overlapping section of the circles. Those are the
    comparisons you will discuss in your essay. The elements outside of
    that common area are the contrasts, or differences, you will
    discuss.  
        
     Is this starting to make a little more sense now?  
        
     Next, notice the two different ways given to set up your comparison
    and contrast essay. Decide which way you feel most comfortable
    using.  
        
     Slide 10 gives an excellent list of word choices to use as
    transitions in writing a comparison and contra and contrast
    essays.  
        
     So now it’s your turn…take all of this wonderful guidance and
    information, and write a literary analysis comparing and contrasting
    the two stories you chose earlier. You may want to go back and look
    in the first unit to refresh your memory about essay structure,
    proofreading, and so forth.  
        
     When you think you are finished with your analysis paper, put it
    down on the table and go for a walk, or go get some ice cream, but
    get away from that paper. When you get back, or even the next day,
    go back to your paper and proofread it for errors. More importantly,
    make sure it says exactly what you want it to say. Make sure you
    have used examples from the stories to back up what you have said.
    When you are satisfied with your work, and I know that only your
    best is satisfying, then write your final draft. Then, show everyone
    the beautiful work you have completed. Congratulations!  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 6 hours.

*There are so many great short stories in literature. Here are a few
that should inspire you to continue reading in the short-story genre.*

-   **Reading: *The Old Man and the Sea* by Ernest Hemingway**
    This is a short novel about an old man struggling against a really
    big fish *and* himself!

-   **Reading: “Hills Like White Elephants” by Ernest Hemingway**
    This story may seem like a simple conversation, but it’s full of
    symbolism. You have to read between the lines to find the true
    story.

-   **Reading: “Bartleby, the Scrivener” by Herman Melville**
    This is another simple story line with a lot of symbolism. You
    should enjoy reading this, or maybe, like Bartleby, you “would
    prefer not to.”

-   **Reading: “Rappaccini’s Daughter” by Nathaniel Hawthorne**
    This is a romantic little story full of allusions. A scientist, some
    poison, and young love are involved, so this story is actually
    comparable to an episode of *CSI*.

-   **Reading: “Ligeia” by Edgar Allen Poe**
    Like Poe’s other short stories, this one should be read by
    candlelight on a stormy night. In this early Poe short story,
    characters include both a dead maiden and a dying maiden. The
    narrator is, of course, in love with at least one of them, and the
    story that follows is chilling.
