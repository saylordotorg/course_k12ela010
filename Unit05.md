**Unit 5: Up from Slavery** <span id="5"></span> 
*After having learned rhetoric and studied examples of historical
speeches, it is sensible for you to follow that by reading a longer,
historically significant text.* Up from Slavery*, by Booker T.
Washington, is a piece of influential nonfiction literature that
provides a window into America’s history while allowing you to hone your
reading comprehension, analysis, and evaluation skills.  
    
 You hopefully will find Washington’s autobiography compelling through a
message of morality and portrayal of the human spirit. Additionally,
after having honed your reading comprehension in previous units, you
likely will spend less time on understanding and more time on higher
order skills: application, analysis, and synthesis of the text.  
    
 Because you have already worked with a variety of prior texts, you will
be expected to complete this book more autonomously: you will rely less
on guided questions or given notes and more on your own annotations and
research. After completing the reading, you will write a literary
response paper on one of the novel’s overarching themes. This paper will
follow the guidelines of previous writing assignments but allow more
room for individual thought and direction, empowering you to take
control and responsibility for your writing.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 49 hours:  
    
 ☐    Subunit 5.1: 5 hours  
    
 ☐    Subunit 5.2: 19 hours  
    
 ☐    Subunit 5.3: 17 hours  
    
 ☐    Subunit 5.4: 8 hours

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   create cogent, detailed, analytical responses to a text – i.e.,
    persuasive writing, research-based expository writing, and literary
    analysis;
-   identify and evaluate the key elements, terminology, and traditions
    of literature;
-   analyze historical fiction and nonfiction texts within their social
    context, and evaluate them for their effectiveness and real-world
    implications; and
-   critically evaluate and critique ideas presented in a narrative or
    persuasive text.

**5.1 Setting and Context** <span id="5.1"></span> 
*Understanding when and where something happens is an integral part of
nonfiction literary analysis. The circumstances surrounding the literary
work are displayed either literally or figuratively based on the setting
and context in which the work is composed. Often, the literary work
exists as a direct result of the setting and context, so it is crucial
to be familiar with the time period and events that may have inspired
the author to put pen to paper.*

how those experiences helped shape him into the man he became.*

    Tuskegee. After reading this article, you will better understand the
    character of Booker T. Washington. Write a paragraph giving three
    examples from this article of life experiences Washington
    encountered that had an obvious impact on an action or decision he
    made later in life. In other words, show how Washington’s earlier
    experiences helped him make choices later. What did he learn from
    those early experiences, and how did he use that knowledge to pave
    the road to his success? Be sure to cite specific passages from the
    text to support your conclusions.

    the degree of success which has actually been attained, but also the
    obstacles which have been overcome in reaching that success.”  
        
     In a paragraph, explain what Washington means by this statement.
    Please give specific examples from this article to support your

**5.3 Thematic Essay** <span id="5.3"></span> 
*There it is again…that dreaded “essay” word! By now you are getting
really good at writing essays, so adding another type to your tool box
will be a simple task. It’s probably no surprise that the thematic essay
is an essay about a theme, or themes, in a literary work. So, this
subunit will help you take the essay writing skills you have and refine
them to write a thematic essay.*

    Metaphor”](http://www.sophia.org/extended-metaphor/extended-metaphor-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this presentation, which explains extended
    metaphors and gives excellent examples with an excerpt from
    Shakespeare’s *As You Like It*. After taking notes and studying the
    example, think about other examples of extended metaphors that you
    have read or heard. A lot of songs use extended metaphors, like
    Kansas’s “Dust in the Wind,” or Sheryl Crow’s “Every Day Is a
    Winding Road.” What? You’ve never heard those songs? Well, after you
    Google them and read the lyrics, notice how each song’s lyrics apply
    the metaphor throughout the entire piece. Now, make a list of three
    current songs you have heard that include extended metaphors. After
    each song’s name, write an explanation about what the extended
    metaphor is in the song.  
        
     Reading this presentation, researching songs, and writing the
    explanations should take approximately 1 hour.

-   **Checkpoint: Checkpoint: Extended Metaphor and *Up from Slavery***
    Checkpoint: Now it’s time for you to put all of your writing skills
    to work again! You will need to reference the notes you have about
    writing an analysis and use the format that you used in earlier
    analysis assignments. Remember to sufficiently support your thesis
    by citing examples from the text. Finally, use your editing,
    revision, and proofreading skills to produce an awesome final draft
    of your paper.  
        
     Booker T. Washington uses many metaphors in *Up from Slavery*. One
    of the metaphors that he uses in his speech, “The Atlanta Exposition
    Address,” is among his most famous. This speech and the following
    quote are found in Chapter XIV of *Up from Slavery*:  
        
     “In all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the
    fingers, yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual
    progress.”  
        
     Write an analytical essay explaining how Washington uses the
    extended metaphor of this quote in his autobiography. Explain the
    meaning of the metaphor and give examples that show how this
    metaphor is extended, or carried out, in *Up from Slavery*.  
        
     Completing this essay, from prewriting to final draft, should take
    approximately 2 hours.

     Instructions: Watch this video about writing a thesis for an
    analytical paper. Since we have spent a great deal of time reading,
    studying, and annotating about Washington’s views on education, your
    thesis statement needs to include education as a prevalent theme in
    *Up from Slavery*. I have given you a jump-start by providing you
    with the following beginning of a thesis statement:  
        
     A prevailing theme in Booker T. Washington’s *Up from Slavery* is
    the importance of education
    to\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  
        
     You do not have to use this particular thesis statement, but should
    you choose to use it, you would fill in the blanks with three
    different ways that the importance of education is stressed in *Up
    from Slavery*. If you need help in determining the three points you
    will use in your thesis statement, look over your annotations. When
    you have decided the three ways you believe education is stressed in
    *Up from Slavery*, please write your thesis statement.  
        
     Watching this video and formulating your thesis statement should
    take approximately 30 minutes.

    it’s time to write! In five paragraphs, write an analytical paper
    explaining how the theme of the importance of education is prevalent
    in Booker T. Washington’s *Up from Slavery*. Be sure to include your
    thesis statement in the introduction of your paper, and give plenty
    of evidence from the text in your supporting paragraphs.

**5.4 Supplemental Texts** <span id="5.4"></span> 
*Booker T. Washington’s message of success through education is also
prevalent in the works of Maya Angelou. An inspiration to all who read
her writing and hear her speak, Maya Angelou’s message includes not only
success through education but also graciousness to all of the trials she
has faced that have made her stronger and more grateful for her
accomplishments.*
