English II is the second in a sequence of English courses for high
school students. These courses seek to give you the necessary reading,
writing, thinking, and research skills to find success in college or the
workplace. As the second course, English II challenges you to look
deeper within a text for its meaning and provide thoughtful, analytical,
and persuasive responses. You will be expected to build literary
analysis from the texts as well as outside sources of knowledge. You
will first learn to dissect a text for varied levels of meaning, how to
interpret this meaning with a critical eye, and how to look beyond the
text for its relevance. You will then be expected to read a variety of
fiction and nonfiction texts of different lengths, complexities, and
genres, and respond to them through questions, annotations, independent
research, and essay writing. Texts and assignments will gradually
increase in rigor, challenging you to improve the efficacy and
complexity of your analysis and writing skills. Because the objectives
of English II are skill based, and therefore transferable across other
disciplines, you will read from a broad spectrum of content. Texts will
include classic fictional literature, historical documents, scientific
studies, current news articles, and materials relevant to the modern-day
workplace. While English Language Arts retains some of its literary
tradition, you should expect the content to align with, and supplement,
the material in your other courses. By the conclusion of English II, you
will be prepared for the material in upper level high school English
courses (and, subsequently, collegiate texts). You will be able to read
and interpret more autonomously, and you will be able to handle more
rigorous texts with fewer instructional supports.
