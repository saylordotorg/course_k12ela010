**Unit 3: *Anthem*** <span id="3"></span> 
*After having read a series of short stories, you will move on to
alonger work of classic literature. Because the previous unit included
fiction, the subsequent novel will also be fiction in order to easily
connect with the given literary themes and elements.  
  *  
 Anthem* is a novel with a strong focus on history, politics, and social
commentary. The author, Ayn Rand, uses the story as a metaphor for her
views on human morality—as it exists in the world versus how she
believes it should be. In this way,* Anthem* is an excellent example of
how literature can reflect and comment on the world around us.  
    
 While reading, you will identify and explain the literary devices used
in the novel; you will infer the author’s intent and analyze how it is
communicated; you will research the story’s context through supplemental
texts and use this outside information as a lens for the story’s
message; and finally, you will respond to the story’s themes in a way
that is relevant to your own experiences.  
  *  
 Anthem* will serve as the primary piece of fictional literature for
this course. Although other novels and texts will be read, this novel
serves as a powerful example of classic American literature. Later in
the course, it will be compared and contrasted with works from other
eras, genres, and locations.*

**3.1 by Ayn Rand** <span id="3.1"></span> 
*This novella—a fancy name for a long short story—is another glimpse at
a dystopian world. This society is so different from the one we know
that “I” is not even a permissible word anymore. That makes reading this
a bit challenging at first, but you will get used to it. Ayn Rand’s own
philosophies about egoism and collectivism are evident throughout this
story. You, I mean “We,” will better understand the symbols, tone, etc.
in this story after spending some time listening to Ayn Rand discussing
her philosophies. There is also a need to learn a bit about what
philosophy is before we can really understand what Ayn Rand believes.
The video clips in this unit are both informative and thought-provoking.
They are also a bit humorous as you watch the cigarette smoke curling
through the air on these old television interviews. That’s something
most of you have never seen before! These philosophies are some pretty
deep stuff. You have to really have your thinking cap fastened tightly.
After you learn a bit about Rand’s life and ideas, keep those
philosophies in mind as you read* Anthem*. “We” hope you enjoy this
unit!*

     Instructions: Click on the first link if you would like to read
    this short story. If you choose to listen, you may click on the
    second link, and choose the preferred audio download. You may also
    choose to read along with the audio. Whichever method you choose,
    *these questions should be completed as you read the story*. You
    will also need to annotate the text while reading. Remember to
    answer the “*Anthem* Question Packet” from above while you are
    reading. These questions will help guide your annotations, so
    answering them as you are reading will go hand-in-hand with
    annotating. The idea is for the question packet to lead the way and
    hopefully spark another concept for an annotation.  
        
     Reading and/or listening to this short story should take
    approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes.

     Instructions: You will need to print these four pages of questions
    or write them down. Whichever method you choose, these questions
    should be completed as you read the story. They will help guide your
    reading, help with your annotations, and help you develop some ideas
    about the theme. The first page of the packet describes four
    different question categories. Study these different types, and as
    you work through this packet, be aware of which type of question you
    are answering. These categories represent different levels of
    thinking, and recognizing them and knowing how to properly respond
    to each is a valuable skill. You may omit the pre-reading Question
    1, since it refers to a summary of the book that you don’t have
    access to with Gutenberg. The page numbers will not correspond with
    the Project Gutenberg reading, so be sure to write down the correct
    page numbers as you complete the questions. This will be very
    important when you are looking for textual evidence to support your
    writing!  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 2 hours.

    of this interview consecutively. Try to tune out the dated camera
    angles, look for the humorous cigarette smoke swirls, and just
    LISTEN to what Rand is explaining. This is actually the author
    speaking about her objectivism philosophies and beliefs. Pretty
    neat, huh? When you have finished watching the all three parts of
    the video, ask yourself what objectivism means. What is
    collectivism? Which one is Rand’s philosophy? If you aren’t quite
    sure, watch the three videos one more time, and write down some of
    the things Rand says about objectivism and collectivism. When you
    think you know the meaning of objectivism and collectivism, write a
    letter to a friend explaining what each of the terms mean and how
    Ayn Rand feels about both objectivism and collectivism. Also, tell
    your friend how you feel about each of the terms.

    Collection”](http://archive.org/details/AynRandCollection) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Surprise! It’s that collection again! But these
    videos are in color and a bit easier to watch! You may still see
    some smoke curling up in the picture though. This time, you will
    watch videos 3, 4, and 5. Collectively (no pun intended), they are
    one interview. Rand talks more in this interview about objectivism
    and collectivism but also about her views on politics and religion.
    Hopefully, this will help you to understand her philosophies a
    little better. Again, if you continue to question what objectivism
    and collectivism are, please watch these twice, or three times!  
        
     Watching these videos should take approximately 30 minutes.

**3.2 Writing Style** <span id="3.2"></span> 
*Some authors write in a very simple style. Others, such as Charles
Dickens or William Faulkner, ramble on for an entire paragraph before
they finally decide they might need to use some end punctuation. We
discussed earlier in this course that style is multi-faceted. This
subunit will involve the study of Ayn Rand’s style—her writing style,
not her fashion style from those archived videos! As you learn more
about Rand’s writing style, think about how it reflects her
philosophies.*

**3.4 Reading Comprehension and Analysis** <span id="3.4"></span> 
*This is the part where you get to use all of those annotation skills we
learned about earlier. Print a copy of* Anthem*, grab a highlighter,
some sticky notes and a pen, and let’s get ready to read and make some
usable notes!*

    Characterization”](http://www.sophia.org/analyzing-characterization/analyzing-characterization-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: This link will take you to a tutorial that we used
    earlier in Unit 2. Just read over the material as a review about
    characterization. Then, using Equality 7-2521 from *Anthem* as your
    character, “stalk” him through Steps 1, 2, and 3 as shown in the
    tutorial. This will be an informal character analysis, but write a
    rough draft, citing examples you find from the story.  
        
     Reviewing this tutorial and writing the character analysis should
    take approximately 2 hours.

**3.5 Importance of Setting** <span id="3.5"></span> 
*Everything has to happen somewhere, right? And depending on where you
are, your actions, experiences, and thoughts probably influence the way
you behave. If your sibling accidentally stomps on your foot in church,
your reaction will hopefully differ from the same stomp occurring at
home. The same is true about the setting in a story. Setting is crucial
in the behaviors and ideals of the characters. Think about* Anthem*.
Would the characters act or think the same way if the setting were in a
present-day city? How would the tone and mood of* Anthem *be different
if it were in a happy little countryside village? Makes a difference,
huh?*

     Instructions: Watch this video. Although this video is about a poem
    called “Michael” by William Wordsworth, this teacher actually goes
    into the Lake District in England to show what a pastoral setting
    really is. She also talks about how Wordsworth considered the cities
    created by the Industrial Revolution to symbolize evil, the opposite
    of the pastoral setting. What do you believe Rand uses the pastoral
    setting in *Anthem* to symbolize? Why do you think so?

     Instructions: Read these definitions for pastoral. For the purpose
    of this assignment, you need to use the third definition about a
    literary work that idealizes rural life. With that definition in
    mind, why do you believe Rand uses a pastoral setting in *Anthem*
    rather than a busy city setting? Write a brief paragraph explaining
    why you believe Rand chose the pastoral setting. Please cite
    examples that show the pastoral setting in the story.  
        
     Reading these definitions and writing the paragraph should take

**3.6 Rand's Message in History** <span id="3.6"></span> 
*Ayn Rand’s message in history is multifaceted, but the bottom line is
that freedom rules! She professed that man should be free from
government regulations and from any interference from the government.
Rand also believed that economic freedom was essential to the success of
any society. She was concerned about the future of the United States if
it continued on its path at the time. What do you think about her
message? Have any of Rand’s concerns about the future of the United
States been correct?*

    theme from *Anthem* and explain how Rand communicates this theme.  
        
     Be sure your thesis statement includes the four elements given on
    page 5 of the packet. After formulating your thesis statement, you
    will be able to continue through this packet, writing and refining
    your literary analysis as you go. You will, of course, use evidence
    from the text to support your thesis.

    complete paragraph 5, as it is a rebuttal paragraph. If you
    disagree, you will state Rand’s beliefs that you disagree with and
    rebut each of them.  
        
     Finally, after collecting all of your thoughts, examples, and
    rebuttals, you will use your prewriting to successfully write a
    persuasive essay.  
        
     Working through this packet and writing the persuasive essay should
    take approximately 3 hours.

-   **Reading: *Fahrenheit 451* by Ray Bradbury**
    Like *Anthem*, this novel has a dystopian setting. Firemen start
    fires rather than putting them out; there’s a love interest on more
    than one level; and ultimately, everyone ends up in the woods to
    “start over.”

-   **Reading: *Metamorphosis* by Franz Kafka**
    *Metamorphosis* is a strange story with several interesting themes.
    Not only will you want to skip the snooze on your alarm clock, you
    will also think twice before squashing a cockroach.
