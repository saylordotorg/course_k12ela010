**Unit 6: Macbeth** <span id="6"></span> 
*Shakespeare can provide rigorous and challenging (but rewarding)
reading experiences for students. As a later unit in the course,*
Macbeth*will encourage you to read closely and carefully for meaning,
while finding relevance in the text’s prevailing themes.*  
    
 *This unit provides an introduction to Shakespeare and the English
Renaissance. You will become accustomed to the literary traditions of
the time along with the Renaissance’s most famous playwright. As the
course’s only play,* Macbeth*will also serve as a general lesson on
dramatic literature.*  
    
 *While reading, you will learn to interpret Shakespeare’s language
through contextual clues, vocabulary acquisition, and summarization. As
you parse the language and gain an understanding of the plot, you will
analyze the play’s finer points: the psychology of the characters, human
nature, and political/social commentary. The unit will culminate in a
multigenre project that exhibits your ability to not only comprehend the
reading but also reflect on its themes.*  
    
 *This unit is challenging, as it deals with a new genre of literature
(dramatic literature) in Elizabethan English and touches upon relatively
complex themes. By rising to meet this challenge, you will find your
reading, writing, and analytical skills much improved. *

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 64 hours.

**6.1 Introduction to the Renaissance** <span id="6.1"></span> 
*What does Renaissance mean? In this case, Renaissance refers to a new
birth, or revival, of art and literature. The Renaissance occurred in
Europe beginning in the 14th century and lasting through the 17th
century. This time period served as a sort of transition period from
medieval times to modern times. To better understand Shakespeare and his
plays, this subunit offers some background about the world in which
Shakespeare lived. *

    and practice reading the way Tony Hill suggests in the video. Does
    reading this way help you better understand the play? Is it easier

**6.2 Introduction to Shakespeare** <span id="6.2"></span> 
Shakespeare…the name alone provokes many feelings in students of
English. Hopefully you have been exposed to at least one or two of his
works by this time in your school career. Perhaps you have read and
studied, or even seen, one of his many plays. Shakespeare is certainly
known as a playwright, but he was also a poet and a businessman. This
subunit will give you a glimpse into who Shakespeare was and share a
small sampling of his sonnets.

    Instructions: Now that you have listened to four of Shakespeare’s
    sonnets, you are going to take a closer look at one of them. For
    citing purposes, you need to choose between “Sonnet 19” or “Sonnet
    20.” Remember, the written text of these sonnets can be found under
    the “Show more” button under each sonnet’s YouTube video. After you
    choose your favorite between the two, write a paragraph explaining
    what you think the sonnet is about. Be sure to cite supporting
    examples from the sonnet. Remember, as long as you can prove your
    opinion with examples, there is no “right” or “wrong”
    interpretation.

**6.3 Reading Macbeth** <span id="6.3"></span> 
Now that you know a little about the Elizabethan era, Shakespeare, and
how to successfully read a Shakespearean play, it’s time to read
*Macbeth*. It is important to remember that Shakespeare did not write
these plays to be read but to be performed on stage. You are going to
read, annotate, and summarize the play one act and scene at a time.
Then, after thoroughly analyzing its literary parts, you will better
understand how the play functions as a whole. After studying the written
text, watching the play will be an event to enjoy, just as Shakespeare
intended.

     Instructions:  Please click on the first link above to access the
    text.  Then, click on the second link to access the *Macbeth*
    packet.  This is a packet that includes pre-writing, activities, and
    a post-writing assignment for each scene.  You will use pages 1–9 of
    this packet while reading all five acts of *Macbeth*, so it is
    probably most convenient to print those nine pages.  If you would
    prefer, you may write down the questions/activity responses for each
    act as the course progresses and you reach each new act.  
        
     You will only need to address the Act I portion of the packet right
    now.  First, complete the pre-writing activity for Act I.  You will
    not need to take notes about Shakespeare and his life at this time
    since we have already covered that.  Next, scroll down to pages 8
    and 9 of the packet. There you will find definitions for the
    dramatic terminology referred to in Scenes 1-3.  When the packet
    asks you to give a plot summary, please use the CLOSE read method.
     This will help you when you have to write a literary analysis about
    *Macbeth* later!  Continue to work through the questions and
    activities after each scene you read in Act I.  Finally, complete
    the post-writing assignment.  
        
     Completing the Act I section of this packet will take approximately
    1 hour.

     Instructions: Click on the link. This analysis of Macbeth trying to
    justify killing Macduff’s family suggests that Macbeth is now acting
    without any conscience or rationality. To borrow a phrase from Nike,
    Macbeth has adopted a “Just Do It!” attitude. Can you think of any
    characters from another book or movie that acted without thinking of
    consequences just to achieve an ambition? What was the result of
    their actions? Have you ever made a poor choice when using a “Just
    Do It” attitude? Write a paragraph explaining how “Just Do It” is
    often a good plan when playing a sport or trying to attain an
    athletic or creative goal. Then, write a paragraph explaining why
    Macbeth’s thoughtless actions to reach his ambition by doing things
    without thinking first will lead to his destruction. By writing
    these two paragraphs, you should be aware that ambition can be good
    or bad, depending on the situation and the steps you take to get
    what you want.  
        
     Watching the analysis and writing the two paragraphs should take

     Instructions: Click on the link for another “ShowMe” presentation,
    which analyzes Macbeth’s expression of horror at the ghost of
    Banquo. After you have watched the analysis, write a paragraph
    explaining why it is ironic when Macbeth says that the ghosts “push
    us from our stools.” How does the comment further develop the
    political power theme in *Macbeth*?

     Instructions: Click on the link for a presentation that examines
    Macbeth’s desire to always want MORE! And, like Veruca Salt in
    *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*, he wants it NOW! And we all
    know that selfish, demanding attitude didn’t work out so well for
    poor Veruca! After watching this presentation, think of other
    characters or people from movies or television—or maybe even in
    political arenas—who let their desire for more and more power lead
    to their demise. Choose one of these characters/people and write a
    paragraph comparing his or her actions to the actions of Macbeth.

    guilty. Oh, come on, everyone has felt a little guilt at one time or
    another. You don’t have to write about what the guilty feeling was
    about, but think about how you finally came to terms with the guilt.
    Can you ever really get rid of guilt? Now, write a paragraph
    explaining why dealing with guilt in an honest and open way is more
    productive than letting it eat you alive like Lady Macbeth chose to
    do.

     Instructions: Click on the link, and watch this video clip about
    the importance of using modern technology in Shakespeare productions
    to grab and keep the attention of today’s youth. What do you think
    about this topic? Do you enjoy watching things in black and white?
    Does it take something away from a “classic” if you make too many
    modern changes? Write a paragraph explaining why incorporating
    different forms of technology into Shakespeare’s plays is a good or
    bad practice. Be sure to support your opinions.  
        
     Watching the video and writing the paragraph should take

     Instructions: Click on the link to access the production of
    *Macbeth* that you enjoyed earlier with some popcorn. Now it’s time
    to trade the popcorn for your thinking cap and write a comparison
    and contrast essay about the differences in this production and the
    text of Shakespeare’s *Macbeth*. You need to rewatch this
    production, looking more closely at the text during the play. Note
    the differences with a highlighter as you read/watch. A Venn diagram
    is always a helpful tool for prewriting this type of essay. When you
    write your formal essay, be sure to cite the text to support your
    comparisons and contrasts.  
        
     Watching the play and writing a formal comparison and contrast
    essay should take approximately 4 hours.

**6.5 Multigenre Project** <span id="6.5"></span> 
A “genre” means a category, and “multi“ means many. So this subunit is
obviously about many categories, right? As a matter of fact, this unit
discusses what you have learned about the content and themes of
Shakespeare’s *Macbeth*. But this unit is also about expressing the
things you have learned in personal, unique ways. Here your creativity
gets to shine! You will create a collection (multi) of products from
different creative categories (genres). This is where your work becomes
your passion, where you choose the way you want to express your
knowledge. You have worked hard dissecting *Macbeth*, and now you get to
put all of it back together in a creative means of your choice. Enjoy!

    Project”](http://trombettaportfolio.wikispaces.com/file/view/project.pdf/289688229/project.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Click on the link. These are the directions for your
    multigenre project. When reading the directions, simply replace the
    words “the novel” with “Shakespeare’s *Macbeth*.” The second page is
    a grading rubric you may use to self-evaluate your finished
    products. It would be worthwhile to make a video presentation
    showing each of your products and explaining how each is
    representative of your *Macbeth* experience. You will need to be
    able to explain why your creation is representative of *Macbeth*. Be
    prepared to explain why you chose to create the product—what was it
    about the play that provoked your choice? How does your creation
    show an important aspect of *Macbeth* or of something you learned by
    reading *Macbeth*? You might even want to post your video on YouTube
    and see what kind of feedback you get about your project. Do your
    best when making a product from each genre. These six creations are
    a reflection of you!  
        
     Completing all six multigenre creations should take approximately
    12 hours.
