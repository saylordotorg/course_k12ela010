**Unit 4: Speech and Rhetoric** <span id="4"></span> 
*To continue the analysis of texts, you will be introduced to a series
of historically important speeches. These speeches vary in historical
context, length, theme, and complexity. By reading, dissecting, and
comparing these speeches, you will have an opportunity to learn three
different pieces of curriculum.  
    
 First, you will hone your critical thinking skills through real-world
examples of poignant writing. By reading and listening to historically
significant speeches, you can analyze and evaluate the speakers’ words,
intentions, and implications. As with any writing, this provides an
opportunity for textual interpretation and response.  
    
 Second, working with excerpts from history will allow you to engage
texts that are socially and politically significant. You can approach
the material from the perspective of a modern viewer, looking back at
culturally important events, or from the perspective of a critic,
examining the speech’s influence on its time.  
    
 Finally, this medium will provide you with an avenue for learning the
practice of rhetoric. You will come to understand how persuasive speech
is used, how logical arguments are formed, and how to evaluate whether
an argument is cogent or fallacious.*

**4.1 Rhetoric** <span id="4.1"></span> 
*The one thing every smooth talker needs…call it a good pitch, the
ability to sell ice cubes to an Eskimo, or maybe even the need to roll
up your pants because stuff is getting deep. Rhetoric is the thing that
a writer or speaker uses to keep the audience engaged and hopefully
mesmerized in approval of whatever it is being said. It comes in many
shapes and sizes, and knowing what rhetoric is can help you better read,
write, and listen.*

     Instructions: Follow the four directions given for working through
    this lesson. In the last step, you predict what you believe King’s
    purpose probably is in his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. Through
    study, you have already determined the purpose of John F. Kennedy’s
    “Inaugural Address.” Also, by studying Patrick Henry’s speech, you
    know that his purpose was similar to Kennedy’s but also had a
    different purpose. In an essay, determine the purpose of Kennedy’s
    “Inaugural Address” and Patrick’s “Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death”
    speech. Explain how you determined the purpose. Then, compare and
    contrast the purposes of the two speeches. Be sure to give
    supporting examples from the speeches.  
        
     Completing the lesson and writing the essay should take
    approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.

    Link: SOPHIA: Sydney Bauer’s
    [“Diction”](http://www.sophia.org/diction/diction-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this tutorial about diction and take notes. The
    tutorial states that diction is part of an author’s style. With that
    in mind, find examples of the diction used by Henry in his speech
    and explain how it defines his style.  
        
     Then, using Kennedy’s inauguration speech, find examples of the
    diction he used and explain how it defines his style.  
        
     Finally, in a comparison/contrast essay, explain how the style of

**4.4 Speech from Alexander the Great** <span id="4.4"></span> 
*Alexander the Great became king at the young age of 20 and had
conquered most of the Middle East by the time he was 26. He has been
called a military genius, and he definitely didn’t have any self-esteem
problems. I suppose a bit of narcissism is required if one is to conquer
the world. More importantly, at least for our study of his great speech
to his tiring troops, Alexander the Great was an actual student of
Aristotle. With the instruction of such a great philosopher, no wonder
his speech is full of great rhetorical devices for us to study!*

    promises for war in Alexander the Great’s speech with the call to
    arms and the rewards and promises for war in Patrick Henry’s “Give
    Me Liberty or Give Me Death” speech. So, in the place of Element \#1
    and Element \#2 in the outline, you will have “Call to Arms” and
    “Rewards and Promises for War,” respectively.  
        
     Creating the outline and writing the essay should take

**4.5 “The Ballot or the Bullet” by Malcolm X** <span id="4.5"></span> 
*So far in this unit, we have read and listened to speeches with
patriotic themes and positive tones about coming together and fighting
for common goals. Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little, will show us a
different kind of speech. His skills as an orator are equally as elegant
as any we have studied so far, but his militant tone and use of
extremist rhetoric to deliver his message offer a different kind of
speech than we have seen so far.*

    a Good Public Speaker”**

    Public
    Speaker”](http://betterlesson.com/document/161761/5-16-11-qualities-of-good-public-speaking-docx?from=search) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read about each of the qualities that a good public
    speaker should have. Unfortunately, you are only able to listen to
    “The Ballot or the Bullet,” so you can’t assess all of the qualities
    listed. Find examples from the speech of each of the qualities
    except eye contact, body language, and facial expressions. Give
    specific examples from the speech when you find one of the other
    qualities listed. Based on your findings, write a paragraph stating
    whether you believe Malcolm X is a good public speaker. Cite
    specific examples to support your statements. Remember, you don’t
    have to agree with a speaker in order for that individual to be
    considered a good speaker.  
        
     After completing the paragraph about the Malcolm X speech, think of
    a speaker you have not only heard before but also seen. It may be
    one from an earlier subunit, like John F. Kennedy. Or you may choose
    one from an earlier unit, like Ayn Rand or John Lewis. You can even
    choose someone from a YouTube video as they deliver a speech. When
    you have chosen a speaker, find examples of the qualities a good
    public speaker should have. This time, you will be able to include
    eye contact, body language, and facial expressions. Cite specific
    examples of each quality you see or hear. Write a paragraph
    explaining the importance of eye contact, body language, and facial
    expressions, giving specific examples from the list you made. Is a
    speech better if you can also observe the speaker?  
        
     Reading this handout and completing these activities should take
    approximately 2 hours.

     Instructions: Use this compare/contrast chart to compare Malcolm
    X’s speech to two of the other “call to arms” speeches. You will
    compare it to Patrick Henry’s “Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death”
    speech and Alexander the Great’s speech to his troops. The title of
    each speech will be filled in across the top of the chart and the
    various characteristics you are addressing in the speeches will be
    filled in down the left side of the chart. So you will replace
    “characters,” “settings,” and “problems/solutions” with the
    following: “tone used in the speech,” “purpose/objective of the
    speech,” and “persuasive techniques used in the speech.”  
        
     After you have completed the comparison chart, write an essay
    comparing the three speeches. You may refer back to the outline form
    in subunit 4.4.4.2 for planning this essay.  
        
     Completing the comparison chart and writing the essay should take
    approximately 2 hours.

**4.6 “We Never Quarrel about Religion” by Red Jacket** <span

*Like Malcolm X, Red Jacket justifiably felt just a little abused by the
white man. Red Jacket’s speech, however, has a much kinder, gentler
message. It’s really important to know what is happening to the Native
Americans during the time of this speech. Pay extra attention to the
historical background provided and consider the situation as you study
this speech.*

     Instructions: Watch this video. Even though this video addresses
    writing and audience, the information is applicable to speeches as
    well. Please take notes about the different kinds of audiences.
    After viewing the video, write down who you think Red Jacket is
    writing the speech for. Is this audience real or intended? General
    or specific? How do you think Red Jacket felt, knowing that his
    audience’s views and standards on the topic of religion were
    absolutely different than his? Does he effectively get his message
    across to his audience? Write a paragraph explaining who Red Jacket
    was writing for in his speech and why making a speech to this
    audience provided challenges for him.  
        
     Watching this video, taking notes, and writing the paragraph should
    take approximately 30 minutes.

**4.7 The Perils of Indifference” by Elie Wiesel** <span
id="4.7"></span> 
*It seems that the last portion of this unit has displayed one civil
injustice after another. Like Malcolm X and Red Jacket, Elie Wiesel
certainly suffered injustices. His, however, were not only civil
injustices but also injustices against humanity. The story of his life
experiences as a young boy during the Holocaust will be somewhat
revealed to you in his background information. This moving speech will
show you his passion for correcting humankind’s wrongs.*

    Theme”](http://www.sophia.org/setting-and-theme/setting-and-theme-tutorial) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: This presentation is referring to setting and theme
    in a story, but we are going to apply it to a speech. The main thing
    you need to take from this presentation is that the setting and the
    theme complement each other. The setting for “The Perils of
    Indifference” is at a White House lecture on the brink of the new
    millennium. There is a horrible situation akin to the Holocaust
    happening in Kosovo at the time of this speech. Many thousands of
    refugees were forced to flee Kosovo by the Serbian ethnic cleansing
    campaign. The plight of those who remained in Kosovo involved mass
    execution and other gross abuses of human rights, all too familiar
    to Elie Wiesel. With that information in mind, write a paragraph
    explaining the importance of Wiesel’s speech at this time.  
        
     Reading this presentation, applying it to the speech, and writing
    the paragraph should take approximately 45 minutes.

     Instructions: Read this presentation, which lists ten common themes
    found in literature. Do any of these themes apply to “The Perils of
    Indifference”? Does more than one of them apply? Can you think of a
    theme for this speech that is not listed in the presentation?  
        
     Once you have determined the theme, or themes, in “The Perils of
    Indifference,” write an essay about the timelessness of the theme in
    this speech. What makes the theme one that will apply to all times,
    when it was delivered, today, and in the future?  
        
     Watching this presentation, determining the theme(s), and writing
    the essay should take approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.

**4.8 Logical Fallacies and Pitfalls** <span id="4.8"></span> 
*The speeches we have studied in this unit have been eloquently written
and delivered. Most of them have been persuasive and used many different
types of rhetorical devices. But did any of these eloquent speeches
contain errors in reasoning? This subunit will address common fallacies
in logic. We will study these fallacies and learn how they may weaken or
strengthen arguments.*

**4.9 Analyzing a Speech** <span id="4.9"></span> 
*It’s show time! In this final subunit, you get to strut your stuff! You
will take the speech you chose as your favorite and critically analyze
it in an essay. Easy, right? Of course it is…you have all the tools you
need in your bag to write a perfect analysis, regardless of the speech
you chose. Don’t be afraid to look back over any of the information you
have read or watched, and you have some good notes to refer to if
necessary. Good luck!*

     Instructions: Read through this presentation about real and
    fictitious settings. Of course, all of the settings in the speeches
    we read are real. This presentation offers a lot of perspective on
    those real settings. Does the setting in your speech take place in
    the recent past or long ago? Can you find your setting on a map? In
    a reference book? Does your speech’s setting lend authenticity to
    the speech?  
        
     Reading through this presentation and applying concepts to the
    speech should take approximately 30 minutes.
