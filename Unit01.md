**Unit 1: Writing Skills** <span id="1"></span> 
*One of the biggest discrepancies among students is writing ability,
especially with regard to grammar and writing mechanics in general.
Before addressing the major texts or assignments of the course, it is
important to address common writing mistakes at the high school level.
These include errors in sentence structure, spelling, punctuation, and
language usage. Additionally, you will benefit from a step-by-step guide
through the writing process and essay structure.  
    
 For writing mechanics, you will read the rules and view examples of
proper writing habits. You will then use these models as a method of
identifying proper versus improper usage and editing given examples.
Finally, you will create your own writing samples, ultimately exhibiting
each of these rules throughout the writing process.  
    
 Having completed these tasks, you should be ready to tackle the
course’s content with a stronger writing voice and greater ability to
formulate your responses.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 21 hours:

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   define and implement proper writing practices to develop
    clear/cogent ideas, detailed/relevant explanations, and
    structured/effective arguments;
-   identify given errors in sentence structure, diction, punctuation,
    and spelling, and correct them according to proper English
    mechanics;and
-   use the “writing process” to develop and structure an academic
    essay.

**1.1 Writing Voice** <span id="1.1"></span> 
*In writing, voice is the style the author uses. But, as I’m sure you
know, style is a combination of so many things! Just as a stylish outfit
may be a combination of a dress, some jewelry, and of course just the
right shoes, a writer’s voice is a combination of the words he chooses,
the tone he takes, and the unique way the writer’s personality is shown
through his writing. Each writer wears the outfit just a bit differently
and chooses which accessories to wear – and how to wear them! If you see
a poem written in all lower-case letters, you may know immediately that
the writer is e. e. cummings, and if you read a paragraph from a short
story by Edgar Allan Poe, you would probably suspect he is the author
just by the way he writes. I bet certain musical artists have a sound
that you can almost always pick out as being “their” sound. This subunit
will further explore the writing voice and hopefully help you to
understand it better.*

     Instructions: Read this handout about proofreading strategies and
    take notes as you read. If you don’t have anyone to listen to you
    read your paper aloud, try recording yourself reading and then
    listen for errors afterwards. Be sure to wait an hour or two between
    recording and proofreading so that you are listening with “fresh
    ears.” Sometimes we think we hear what we meant to say! Waiting a
    bit before proofreading can help you hear or see errors you missed
    the first time. Can you think of any other common mistakes to add to
    the checklist under number 3?

**1.7 Essay Writing** <span id="1.7"></span> 
*After mastering the writing process, writing an essay is a piece of
cake! Basically, the steps of writing are simply expanded from paragraph
size into a larger work. The paragraph becomes a part of a larger
explanation. Examples or quotations are added for further explanation,
and what begins as a simple thesis, or main idea, becomes a full-blown
explanation.*

**Extension Resources** <span id="1.8"></span> 
*I know, I know...you just can’t get enough of this awesome class! I
totally understand, so here are some other things for you to read and
enjoy that will enhance what you have already learned.*

-   **Reading: *The Elements of Style* by William Strunk, Jr. and E. B.
    White**
    Not many textbooks from college gain a permanent place on one’s
    personal bookshelf, but this one has been with me since my freshman
    year. This little book contains a wealth of information about basic
    writing fundamentals. I guess it’s really a reference book, but it’s
    a great read as well. It’s definitely worth investing your time and
    money for a copy. I bet you will be surprised at how many times you
    refer to it in the future.

-   **Reading: *Grammar Girl’s Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing*
    by Mignon Fogarty**
    This book is like *The Elements of Style*, but with a modern, sassy
    twist. Fogarty also has podcasts about grammar that you can
    download. The book is great with or without the podcasts. It’s one
    of those books that you accidentally learn from while enjoying.
    Another reference-type book, you will visit it again and again.
